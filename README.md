# SafeNetATM
A simple ATM application built to demonstrate my skills to SafeNet.

Development is done using TDD. Classes are defined with their data members and methods but not implemented. Then tests are written to define expected outcomes of methods. The methods are then implemented to pass the tests and tests are adjusted as scope/design changes.


Build Dependencies:
-.NetCore 3.1
-Windows SDK 10.0

To run the command line application, run SafeNetATM\SafeNetATM\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\SafeNetATM
To run the Web Application, open the SafeNetWebATM\SafenetWebATM.sln in Visual Studio 2019. Compile and build the application and then run the application.
